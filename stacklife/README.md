# StackLife
Instructions on how to get started for the *StackLife* hackathon at Brown University as part of Discovery Days (June/2017)

    Channel A: StackLife (data provided) â€” integrating virtual browse in discovery systems

A good place to start is Harvard's original prototype: http://stacklife.harvard.edu/

Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/harvard-lil/stacklife). This has instructions on how to get it running locally in your box (it requires PHP, MySQL, and Apache).

You can also take a look at [StackView](https://github.com/harvard-lil/stackview/), a jQuery plug-in to display the data.


## Demos
A few sites using StackLife

* Harvard's original prototype: http://stacklife.harvard.edu/
* Brown (standalone): https://search.library.brown.edu/browse/b3130393
* Brown (in-place): https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/b3130393?nearby=y
* Cornell: http://stackview.library.cornell.edu/

A few sites using something similar to allow browsing

* Stanford: https://searchworks.stanford.edu/browse?barcode=36105008570488&start=2766559&view=gallery


## Play with the code locally
For the hackathon we'll use [a fork of StackView](https://github.com/hectorcorrea/stackview) that has a quick and easy way to play with StackView with live data coming from the Brown University Library web site.

The demo with the live data requires that you have Node.js installed on your machine. To verify that you do run the following command from the Terminal:

```
node --version
```

You should see something along the lines of `v6.2.2`, the version number is not very important, the code should work with older/newer versions on Node. However, if you see `command not found` it means Node.js is not installed on your machine and you'll need to get it from https://nodejs.org/.

Once you've verified that Node.js is installed on your machine, follow these steps to get the sample code running:

```
cd
git clone https://github.com/hectorcorrea/stackview.git
cd stackview
node server.js
```

Then browse to http://localhost:8000/demo/basic.html this will show you StackView running with two hardcoded items. You can see the data for the hard-code items in file demo/basic.html.

Then browse to http://localhost:8000/demo/brown.html, this will show you StackView running and fetching data from the Brown University Library API. Ideally you should implement a similar API at your institution to get the same behavior. You can see the call to fetch the data in file demo/brown.html.


## Normalizing call numbers
StackLife and StackView provide a great frontend foundation for the *display* of items in a virtual shelf but you still need to implement a backend component to provide the data to the frontend.

The implementation of this backend is not too complicated but it requires that the call numbers in the backend are normalized so that they can be sorted. There are many programs to normalize call numbers, you can see the code that we used to normalize our call numbers in [this Python program](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/bul-search/blob/master/misc/callnumber_norm/callnumbers.py).

We store our normalized callnumbers in a SQL table, you view the definition of the `callnumber` table [here](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/bul-search/blob/master/db/schema.rb). We use plain good-old SQL queries to fetch items that are near a given callnumber, you can see these queries [here](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/bul-search/blob/master/app/models/callnumber.rb)

We use an controller to allow the StackView plug-in to fetch the data from our tables. You can see the code for this controller [here](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/bul-search/blob/master/app/controllers/api_controller.rb).
