# StackLife
Instructions on how to get started for the *StackLife* hackathon at Brown University as part of Discovery Days (June/2017)

    Channel A: StackLife (data provided) â€” integrating virtual browse in discovery systems

A good place to start is Harvard's original prototype: http://stacklife.harvard.edu/

Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/harvard-lil/stacklife). This has instructions on how to get it running locally in your box (it requires PHP, MySQL, and Apache).

You can also take a look at [StackView](https://github.com/harvard-lil/stackview/), a jQuery plug-in to display the data.
